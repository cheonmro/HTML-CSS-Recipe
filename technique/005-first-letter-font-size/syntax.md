# ::first-letter

::first-letter CSS pseudo-element selects the first letter of the first line of a block, if it is not preceded by any other content (such as images or inline tables) on its line.

A first line has only meaning in a block-container box, therefore the ::first-letter pseudo-element has only an effect on elements with a display value of 
- block
- inline-block
- table-cell
- list-item
- table-caption

In all other cases, ::first-letter has no effect.
